inners: ['{"title":"A. Assessment of physical and mental health needs and health checks","description":"The assessment of physical and / or mental health needs can be complex Many specific health conditions are considerably more prevalent in the learning disability population, epilepsy, respiratory conditions, anxiety for example There can be difficulties in detecting and recognising conditions and symptoms (often atypical) of specific health conditions. Understanding interactions between specific learning disability conditions and the environment also requires consideration. Annual Health checks can help to reduce some of these difficulties.","options":[{"title":"Physical and / or mental health needs not assessed and / or there is no current annual health check.","description":"This level applies where there has been no appropriate or effective assessment of needs and / or no annual health check. There is likely to be undiagnosed illness because signs and symptoms have not been recognised. Health problems may be seen as part of the learning disability (diagnostic overshadowing). There will be a lack of health surveillance for people who have problems communicating. There may be serious safeguarding concerns in relation to the assessment of health needs."},{"title":"Physical and / or mental health needs remain under assessment and / or an annual health check is planned but has not been completed.","description":"This level applies where there have been delays in completing assessment processes. It may be that inconsistent approaches have been taken to diagnosis of illness because signs and symptoms have not always been recognised or understood. Pain assessment is likely to be very limited."},{"title":"Physical and / or mental health needs have been assessed / health check done but actions are not in place.","description":"This level applies where an assessment has been carried out but there are delays in meeting the needs that have been identified. It may be that the needs are not being prioritised or that the complexity of meeting the need is preventing appropriate action from being taken or referral for other interventions has not been made."},{"title":"Physical and / or mental health needs have been assessed, a health check carried out and are being acted on.","description":"This level applies where needs have been properly assessed and appropriate action is being taken. The identified needs are not yet resolved but progress is being made."},{"title":"Physical and / or mental health needs assessed and fully met.","description":"This level applies where needs have been fully assessed and appropriate action has been taken that fully meets those needs."}]}','{"title":"B. Long Term Condition (LTC) pathways and planned reviews of need","description":"Many people with learning disabilities have long term conditions, however the established pathways for the treatment of such conditions (dementia, epilepsy, diabetes etc.) are not always provided. People’s needs change over time and therefore require regular review. Some people with learning disabilities can continue to receive treatments that are no longer appropriate or required","options":[{"title":"No Long Term Condition (LTC) pathway allocation or planned review.","description":"This level applies where there are health issues which have not been, or are not being followed up. There may be a lack of sensitivity or awareness of health signs and symptoms. Recognition of changes in health state is likely to be very poor. Indicated long term care pathway allocation has not been made. There may be serious safeguarding concerns in relation to care pathway allocation or review of needs."},{"title":"3B Awaiting review and / or Long Term Condition (LTC) pathway allocation.","description":"This level applies where the need for a review is acknowledged but has not taken place. There will be known health issues that need to be followed up. Recognition of health signs, symptoms and changes in health state is likely to be inconsistent."},{"title":"Review of needs completed but not acted on such as allocation onto Long Term Condition (LTC) pathway.","description":"This level applies where a review of needs has been carried out but the required actions have yet to be implemented. It may be that the actions are not being prioritised or that the complexity of making the required changes is preventing appropriate action from being taken."},{"title":"Review of needs completed and acted on such as allocation onto Long Term Condition (LTC) pathway.","description":"This level applies where a review of needs has been carried out and the actions arising from it are being implemented. This could be that long term condition pathway actions are being carried out with reasonable adjustments."},{"title":"Review of needs not required.","description":"This level applies if there are no needs indicated or identified which require review. There is no requirement for any intervention."}]}','{"title":"C. Care Planning / health action planning","description":"Care planning is the means by which care needs are identified. The care plan is an important focus for good communication; it should guide the work of others and be a basis for continuity of care. Health Action plans identify what needs to happen and who needs to do it. There can be difficulties if these plans are unclear, inadequate, misleading, contradictory or not acted on appropriately.","options":[{"title":"No Care plans / Health action plans in place.","description":"This level applies where the person has needs requiring specific actions but no care plans are in place. This means that the person is not getting adequate support with their health needs; there may be serious safeguarding concerns in relation to care planning."},{"title":"Non condition specific care plans / Health Action plans in place (not condition specific, or NICE compliant).","description":"This level applies where a person has care plans in place but they do not address the specific conditions that are known to exist. For example someone with Down’s syndrome who does not have thyroid function testing identified in their care planning, or someone with epilepsy who does not have a care plan for the management of seizures that is in line with NICE guidance."},{"title":"Condition specific, NICE compliant care plans / Health Action Plans in place but not reviewed or person centred.","description":"This level applies where care plans are in place to address specific known conditions; however the plans are generic and not individualised or person centred. It is likely that the care plans have not been effectively reviewed."},{"title":"Condition specific, NICE compliant care plans / Health Action Plans in place, person centred and regularly reviewed.","description":"This level applies where there are known assessed needs for which specific care plans exist. The care plans will be based around the specific needs of the person in a personalised way. The care plans will be regularly and effectively reviewed."},{"title":"No care plans or Health Action Plans required.","description":"This level applies where there is no requirement for care plans as a full and thorough assessment has not identified any unmet needs."}]}','{"title":"D. Crisis / emergency planning and hospital passports","description":"Emergency plans can prevent a lot of the difficulties associated with a crisis or urgent admission to hospital. They are only effective if they are regularly reviewed and updated and they focus on the specific needs of the individual, are person centred and take account of local circumstances. Hospital passports help to ensure that an individual’s needs are met if and when they need to be admitted or if they require hospital treatment or assessment.","options":[{"title":"No crisis, emergency or relapse plans (where appropriate) or hospital passport in place.","description":"This level applies where there are no plans to respond to a crisis of health need. A hospital passport has not been completed. There may be serious safeguarding concerns in relation to crisis or emergency planning."},{"title":"Crisis / emergency / relapse plans and hospital passport in place, not person centred or reviewed.","description":"This level applies where crisis and / or emergency plans, and a hospital passport have been completed but are inadequate or out of date; this may be because they are not person centred, not robust or fit for purpose."},{"title":"Crisis / emergency / relapse plans and hospital passport in place, not reviewed.","description":"This level applies where crisis and / or emergency plans, and a hospital passport are person centred but have not been reviewed."},{"title":"Crisis / emergency / relapse plans and hospital passport in place, are person centred and reviewed.","description":"This level applies where crisis, emergency and, where appropriate, relapse plans and a hospital passport are all in place. These plans are person centred, individualised and regularly reviewed."},{"title":"No crisis / emergency plans required, hospital passport in place.","description":"This level applies where a person does not require any emergency or crisis plans; they are likely to have good networks of support and good communication. A hospital passport is complete, person centred and up to date."}]}','{"title":"E. Medication","description":"Due to increased co-morbidity, people with learning disabilities often take multiple medications giving rise to complex interactions. In some instances they are more prone to adverse and atypical effects of medications and yet may have difficulty reporting side effects which are hazardous to health and wellbeing. People who present challenging behaviour may be subjected to unlicensed prescribing of anti-psychotics. On occasion people may require covert administration of medication; this should always be subject to appropriate capacity assessment and best interest processes.","options":[{"title":"Inappropriate medication or unlawful covertly administered medication.","description":"This level applies where medication is being used that is not in keeping with the individual’s identified needs e.g. not prescribed for a diagnosed and / or licensed use, or in excess of recommended dose limits. Medication recommended for short term use may have been taken for prolonged periods without regular review (e.g. benzodiazepine anxiolytics, prophylactic antibiotics); Or medication which has hazardous side effects and a narrow therapeutic window- or where medication is being given covertly without consent (where there is capacity) or best interest decision. Those providing support are not managing medication safely or there are major problems with compliance. There may be serious safeguarding concerns in relation to medication."},{"title":"Medication not reviewed and / or regularly monitored.","description":"This level applies where despite poly-pharmacy medication continues to be administered without a specialist review; or the effectiveness, or side effects are not being adequately monitored. A full review of all medication should occur annually as a minimum. Those providing support are not managing medication appropriately or there are significant problems with compliance."},{"title":"Medication reviewed but not regularly monitored.","description":"This level applies where medication may be being reviewed (perhaps annually) but there is poor on-going monitoring of effectiveness or side effects. Those providing support are not monitoring or recording medication effectively or there are limited problems with compliance."},{"title":"Medication reviewed and monitored.","description":"This level applies where medication is carefully monitored and recorded with regular and appropriate review. Those providing support are monitoring and recording medication effectively and there are minimal problems with compliance."},{"title":"No medication.","description":"This level applies where there is no current medication required."}]}','{"title":"F. Specialist learning disability service provision","description":"This indicator relates to the access and quality of specialist learning disability services and their ability to provide a level of support that meets an individual’s specialist health needs that would otherwise not be met in a mainstream setting alone.","options":[{"title":"No specialist learning disability service provision available.","description":"This level applies where a specialist learning disability service is not available to an individual. This may be because there is a lack of specialist service provision locally or that access is being denied or withheld. There may be serious safeguarding concerns. In relation to the lack of appropriate specialist service provision."},{"title":"Restricted specialist learning disability services available, not able to meet all identified needs.","description":"This level applies where some specialist learning disability service is available but access may be restricted, delayed or not available locally. There is no support to access the service available. There may be areas of identified need that cannot be met."},{"title":"Limited specialist learning disability service available.","description":"This level applies where a limited specialist learning disability service is available locally and being provided but there are limitations in the quality or scope of the service available. There is limited support to access the service."},{"title":"1F Full specialist learning disability service available.","description":"This level applies where a full high quality specialist service is available and being accessed by the individual.
