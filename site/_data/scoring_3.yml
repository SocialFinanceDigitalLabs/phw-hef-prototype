title: '4. Personal Behaviour and Lifestyle Indicators.'
inners: ['{"title":"A. Diet and hydration","description":"People with learning disabilities commonly take poor diets. In some instances, due to reduced health literacy, they have a poor understanding of what a healthy diet is. Other people are dependent on carer knowledge to ensure they receive a balanced and nutritious diet. Some people risk health complications associated with excessive or restricted fluid intake. People may have specific dietary requirements due to other health conditions, or medication side effects. Given the high incidence of swallowing difficulties, some people require food and drinks to be of a modified safe consistency.","options":[{"title":"Major restrictions to healthy eating and drinking.","description":"This level applies where the person has known swallowing difficulties but is not having the consistency of their food modified. May take little or no food or fluid without considerable encouragement and this is not readily available. Eats hazardous (otherwise inedible) items. Takes foods hazardous to known health status e.g. high sugar foods if diabetic or foods contraindicated by medication with no support to modify. Or there are serious safeguarding concerns."},{"title":"Significant restrictions to healthy eating and drinking.","description":"This level applies where food consistency is not wholly safe. The person may drink excessively or alternately takes minimal fluids. The amount of food taken is a significant concern. There may be a complete omission of one or more essential component (e.g. fruit, veg or dairy products) OR an extreme excess of an unhealthy constituent of food (e.g. salt or saturated fat) OR wholly inadequate calorific intake. Little support to modify nutritional intake."},{"title":"Limited restrictions to healthy eating and drinking.","description":"This level applies where the person takes a mix of grain based foods, milk, meat, veg and fruit though widely discrepant from normal recommended daily amounts – some support to address these issues and support healthy intake. If food consistency is an issue there may be occasional lapses of stringency in support."},{"title":"Minimal restrictions to healthy eating and drinking.","description":"This level applies where the person takes adequate food and fluid of safe and appropriate consistency. There may be relative excesses or limitations of some key areas of nutritional intake. Meals may lack variety or have modestly excessive salt content. Support is available to address known issues."},{"title":"No restrictions to healthy eating and drinking.","description":"This level applies where the person takes a healthy balanced diet consistent with their needs and prepared in a manner which can be taken without risk. They take 6-8 glasses of water (or other fluids) per day and carers are well informed and provide support regarding public health recommendations on healthy eating."}]}','{"title":"B. Exercise","description":"People with learning disabilities often lead a more sedentary lifestyle than non-disabled peers. There may be issues of motivation or inadequate levels of support to allow engagement in exercise. Some people have extremely complex physical disabilities that mean traditional activities by way of exercise are difficult to engage in. Exercise can be a lifestyle activity (in other words, walking to the shops or taking the dog out) or structured exercise or sport, or a combination of these; it does need to be of at least moderate intensity, measured by it making the person slightly breathless or a little warm.","options":[{"title":"Major restrictions related to exercise.","description":"This level applies where the person takes little or no exercise of an even mild intensity. May be immobile or just sedately mobilising around living environment. Poses risks to skin integrity, cardiovascular system, bones and joints. Alternatively may undertake high intensity, vigorous activity despite significant underlying medical conditions which mean excessive cardio vascular work load should be avoided. No appropriate support with exercise in place. There may be serious safeguarding concerns in relation to exercise."},{"title":"3B Significant restrictions related to exercise.","description":"This level applies where the person takes little or no moderately vigorous exercise, or undertakes energetic activity for brief periods only; no more than once or twice a week. Restricted access to support, understanding in relation to exercise of those providing support is minimal."},{"title":"Limited restrictions related to exercise.","description":"This level applies where the person takes less than a weekly total of an hour and a half of moderately vigorous activity. Takes such exercise on less than four days per week. Support available but not appropriately implemented or utilised."},{"title":"Minimal restrictions related to exercise.","description":"This level applies where the person undertakes moderate intensity activity on four or five days per week, or for less than 30 minutes in a day. Appropriate support and encouragement is provided."},{"title":"No restrictions related to exercise.","description":"This level applies where the person takes a degree of exercise of a nature and quantity appropriate to age and general health condition. A mixture of aerobic and muscle strengthening activities on five or more days per week. No support required."}]}','{"title":"C. Weight","description":"People with learning disabilities are prone to being either overweight or underweight. Obesity brings a whole range of risks in its own right and can also increase the hazardous nature of exposure to other determinants of health in (e.g. genetic cardio vascular problems or hazardous medications). Being underweight or malnourished increases risk of serious medical complications including recurrent infection and impaired renal function.","options":[{"title":"Major restrictions to maintaining appropriate weight.","description":"This level applies where BMI is less than 15 or over 40. There has been unplanned loss of more than 10% weight over 3-6 months. No support available to achieve or maintain appropriate weight. There may be serious safeguarding concerns in relation to weight."},{"title":"Significant restrictions to maintaining appropriate weight.","description":"This level applies where BMI is between 15-16 OR 35-40 There is unplanned loss of 5-10% weight over 3-6 months. Restricted access to support to achieve or maintain appropriate weight."},{"title":"Limited restrictions to maintaining appropriate weight.","description":"This level applies where BMI is between 16-18.5 OR 30-5. There is unplanned loss of less than 5% weight over 3-6 months. Support available but not appropriately implemented or utilised to achieve or maintain appropriate weight."},{"title":"Minimal restrictions to maintaining appropriate weight.","description":"This level applies where BMI is between 25-30. Weight is stable. Appropriate support and encouragement is provided to achieve or maintain appropriate weight."},{"title":"No restrictions to maintaining appropriate weight.","description":"This level applies where BMI is between 18-25. Weight is stable. No support is required to achieve or maintain appropriate weight."}]}','{"title":"D. Substance Use","description":"Vulnerable people can be become engaged in the harmful use of alcohol, smoking and non-prescription drugs and other harmful substances. This can make them particularly vulnerable to exploitation and may result in problems with relationships, finances and offending behaviour. They may find it difficult, or be reluctant to engage with activities to change their behaviours. Some people may have developed ritualised behaviours or be dependent on routine. In addition people often need support from others, who may not be well informed about the harmful impact of alcohol, smoking and other dangerous substances, or skilled in supporting and managing risky behaviours.","options":[{"title":"Dependence on drugs, alcohol, or other harmful substances.%%%%","description":"This level applies where there is evidence of a strong compulsion to take the desired substance, where a withdrawal state is associated with abstinence There may be evidence of tolerance (indicated by increasing quantities of the desired substance being required to achieve the desired effect). Alternative pleasures are neglected. No support or access to services in place. There may be serious safeguarding concerns in relation to substance use."},{"title":"Harmful use of drugs, alcohol, tobacco or other harmful substances.","description":"There is an evident pattern of substance use which has significantly contributed to physical, psychological or social harm. Limited support or access to services."},{"title":"Hazardous use of drugs alcohol, tobacco or other harmful substances.","description":"This level applies where consumption is associated with a significantly increased risk of harm, albeit that there is currently no evidence of actual harm. This is the minimal level that is associated with recreational drug use. Some support provided."},{"title":"Minimal misuse of alcohol or tobacco.","description":"This level applies where there is evidence of some risky behaviour in relation to the use of alcohol or tobacco. Behaviours demonstrated are considered to pose a limited risk to the person’s health and wellbeing with potential for morbidity. E.g. where the person generally keeps alcohol consumption to a safe level, but occasionally drinks an excessive amount. Support available if needed."},{"title":"No harmful pattern of substance use.","description":"This level applies where there is use of no substances other than alcohol and where drinking is within Public Health recommended safe limits. (or where there is no use of alcohol). Consumption poses a minimal risk to health and wellbeing. E.g. Where the person consumes alcohol regularly but the amount is considered acceptable (Per week- at least two alcohol-free days, Men- no more than 21 units & no more than four units a day, Women- no more than 14 units, & no more than three units a day)."}]}','{"title":"E. Sexual Health","description":"Many people with learning disabilities engage in appropriate and healthy sexual acts and relationships. If they do this without having accessed sexual health services / education this may place their health at risk. Others are vulnerable and at risk of exploitation or given a lack of appropriate role models may engage in behaviours that are considered to be sexually unusual or unsafe (if not illegal).","options":[{"title":"Very high risk sexual behaviours. Sexual abuse or sexual offending.","description":"In an abusive / exploitative sexual relationship. Engages in sexual offending behaviour. Has unprotected sex with people who are at high risk for sexually transmitted disease. No positive role models for normal, adaptive sexual relationships. No support provided. There may be serious safeguarding concerns in relation to sexual health."},{"title":"Unsafe and risky sexual behaviours.","description":"Has frequent unprotected sex of a nature that is hazardous to health, poses serious safeguarding issues or is illegal. Has been exposed to sexually inappropriate role models. Has had (and failed to detect) chronic sexually transmitted disease. Restricted support provided Limited support or access to services."},{"title":"Inappropriate sexual behaviours increasing vulnerability.","description":"Has limited awareness of sexual rights / norms though is sexually active. Has limited access to sexual health services. Limited understanding of what constitutes safe sex. Has had a lack of sexually positive role models. Lives in an environment where others display sexually inappropriate behaviours. Sexually active but not using contraception. Some support provided."},{"title":"Safe sexual behaviours of a restricted nature","description":"Has accessed contraceptive advice both to avoid pregnancy and the risk of sexually transmitted diseases. Is interested in sex though is sexually isolated. Appropriate support provided."},{"title":"Healthy sexual behaviours.","description":"Engages in safe sexual practices or does not engage in sexual activity by choice. Ready access to sexual health screening services."}]}','{"title":"F. Risky Behaviour / Routines","description":"Presentations of behaviours that may be described as ‘challenging’ i.e. place the safety and wellbeing of the service user and / or others in jeopardy or which increase the likelihood of a person being excluded from ordinary community living, may increase the risk of poor health. Such behaviours include aggression, self injury, destructive behaviours and other difficult or disruptive behaviours (in some instances this latter category may include people who have rigid and fixed routines / habits of such intensity that they prevent the person from engaging in positive health behaviours). Clearly self injury carries such risks as may the defensive or restraining actions of others. Consequences of all behaviours include greater exposure to abuse, inappropriate treatments, social exclusion, deprivation and neglect; each of these can have significant additional negative impacts. People who present such behaviours may be at heightened risk of such behaviours being viewed as being inevitably associated with their learning disability rather than indicative of poor health. Some fixed routines mean that people are resistive to making lifestyle changes which promote improved health.","options":[{"title":"Major health implications related to presentation of severe behavioural disturbance.","description":"The person presents behaviours which are of a frequency, severity or intensity that there is a high risk that unplanned hospital attendances will be required due to severe injury. Or the person’s behaviours mean they have no access to usual health provision. Or the person’s situation is such that they are exposed to abusive contingencies. The factors that predict the occurrence or, and maintain behaviours are unknown."},{"title":"Behaviours / routines have significant impact on health status.","description":"The person presents behaviours for reasons which are poorly understood, which mean that they commonly require first aid or occasionally suffer more serious illness / injury which require medical attention. There may be occasional dramatic escalations in the severity / frequency of behaviours of concern. In an attempt to manage risks the person may be subjected to restrictive environment or hazardous treatments."},{"title":"Limited impact of risky behaviours / routines on health.","description":"The person presents with a range of behaviours of concern. Causative factors have been partially assessed and are partly understood. Access to routine healthcare provision may be difficult to arrange or investigations not pursued as not felt justifiably to be in the person’s best interests. The impact of behaviours is relatively stable and their frequency / severity is neither increasing nor reducing."},{"title":"Behavioural presentation has minimal impact on health status.","description":"The person presents occasional hazardous behaviours or has some rigidity however these have been assessed and a package of proactive and reactive strategies agreed. These are consistently implemented and the outcomes of these strategies are closely monitored and regularly reviewed. The person has unimpaired access to the usual range of local health provision."},{"title":"No presentation of risky behaviours / routines.","description":"The person does not present culturally abnormal behaviours which place themselves or others safety / wellbeing in serious jeopardy or risk the person being denied access to ordinary community facilities."}]}']
