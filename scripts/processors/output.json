Activity can range from different types of employment, education, training, home or community based activities, and these may be formal or informal. A good measure of meaningfulness is the degree of engagement in the activity.

Risky Behaviour / Routines","description":"Presentations of behaviours that may be described as ‘challenging’ i.e. place the safety and wellbeing of the service user and / or others in jeopardy or which increase the likelihood of a person being excluded from ordinary community living, may increase the risk of poor health. Such behaviours include aggression, self injury, destructive behaviours and other difficult or disruptive behaviours (in some instances this latter category may include people who have rigid and fixed routines / habits of such intensity that they prevent the person from engaging in positive health behaviours). Clearly self injury carries such risks as may the defensive or restraining actions of others. Consequences of all behaviours include greater exposure to abuse, inappropriate treatments, social exclusion, deprivation and neglect; each of these can have significant additional negative impacts. People who present such behaviours may be at heightened risk of such behaviours being viewed as being inevitably associated with their learning disability rather than indicative of poor health. Some fixed routines mean that people are resistive to making lifestyle changes which promote improved health.","options":[{"title":"4E Major health implications related to presentation of severe behavioural disturbance.","description":"The person presents behaviours which are of a frequency, severity or intensity that there is a high risk that unplanned hospital attendances will be required due to severe injury.
