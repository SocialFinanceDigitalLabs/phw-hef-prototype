1. Social Indicators.
   ++++
   A. Accommodation%%%%
   The quality of living standards for people with learning disabilities can vary widely. When
   considering accommodation it is important to consider the physical and the social
   environment. Risks may exist because of the physical environment (extreme damp,
   unsafe electrics, lack of adaptation around mobility problems etc.), or arise from the
   social environment (overcrowding, bullying, aggression from others, etc).
   --
   
   Accommodation presenting high
   risk, or in hospital / prison with no
   discharge accommodation
   identified or homeless.
   $$$$This level applies to a person who has no settled
   accommodation, who may be in temporary short term
   accommodation with no appropriate move-on
   accommodation identified, or in accommodation that is
   directly impacting on their health and wellbeing. This
   includes those who are living in restrictive settings such
   as hospitals or prison. There may be serious
   safeguarding concerns in relation to accommodation.
   --
   
   Inappropriate accommodation /
   accommodation at risk of
   breakdown.
   $$$$This level applies where a person is in accommodation
   which is does not meet to their identified health and
   social needs; or where the accommodation is fragile and
   likely to break down (e.g. due to negative relationships
   with peers / neighbours, lack of suitably skilled support,
   offending behaviour, or where notice has been served by
   the accommodation provider).
   --
   
   Shared accommodation with
   others / family – not by choice.
   $$$$This level applies where accommodation is shared with
   others though not either chosen by the individual, or
   agreed through an appropriate best interest process.
   Similarly, where individuals continue to live with their
   family despite the fact that they or their family would
   prefer independence move to more independent living.
   
   --
   Settled single accommodation or
   shared with self-selected others.
   $$$$This level applies where a person lives in
   accommodation either of their choosing or following
   appropriate best interest processes. This will however be
   in some form of registered care or where they do not
   have tenancy rights or full control over their care and / or
   support.
   
   --
   Settled family accommodation or
   own tenancy / ownership reflecting
   personal choice.
   $$$$This level applies where a person is in settled
   accommodation either of their choosing or following a
   appropriate best interest process. Either the person
   themselves of their family have control over their
   tenancy, care and support.
   ++++
   B. Employment, meaningful activities and engagement%%%%
   Being engaged in meaningful activity is not dependent on degree of disability; it will be
   unique for everyone, what is meaningful for one person may not be meaningful to
   another. Activity can range from different types of employment, education, training, home
   or community based activities, and these may be formal or informal. A good measure of
   meaningfulness is the degree of engagement in the activity. A meaningful activity for
   someone with profound intellectual and multiple learning disabilities may be massage, or
   listening to music, for more independent people it may be cooking or attending a club, for
   others it could be fulltime employment or attendance at a college course of their choice.
   --
   
   No meaningful activities /
   engagement.
   $$$$This level applies where a person has no meaningful
   activities or engagement. They will be spending long
   periods of time with no stimulus or engagement; or they
   may be engaged in activities that are not meaningful to
   them. There may be serious safeguarding concerns in
   relation to levels of activity and engagement.
   --
   3B
   Highly restricted activity /
   engagement levels.
   $$$$This level applies when a person’s access to meaningful
   activities is extremely restricted, either for very brief
   periods or only intermittently available. It may be that
   very few appropriate activities have been identified.
   Activities may only be provided within the person’s home
   environment and there is little or no access the wider
   community.
   --
   
   Limited meaningful activities /
   engagement.
   $$$$This level applies where a person has some activities
   which are meaningful to them, or a range of activities
   have been identified but nonetheless access to them is
   limited or unpredictable.
   --
   
   Voluntary work or other structured
   meaningful activity / engagement.
   $$$$This level applies where a range of meaningful activities
   are available; they are most likely structured and
   accessed regularly. There may be a combination of
   formal and informal activity; or for people who are able to
   work, opportunities exist for engagement in voluntary
   employment.
   --
   
   In paid employment or education,
   fully engaged.
   $$$$This level applies where a person is engaged with a
   range of meaningful activities that include paid
   employment or education of their choice and / or
   engagement in a range of meaningful activities in
   different environments with different people.
   ++++
   C. Financial support%%%%
   The links between financial security and health are clear from the evidence. The majority
   of people with learning disabilities are in receipt of some sort of benefit, however
   sometimes there is a sense that finances are inadequate to meet an individual’s needs.
   Material poverty can affect a person’s ability to take a nutritious diet or to engage in
   activities within their community. Where entitlements are not taken up or monies are
   being held back by another party (see safeguarding) this can directly impact on an
   individual’s health and well being.
   --
    Minimal or no financial support.
   $$$$This level applies where a person is in receipt of either
   no or else very limited financial support. This could be
   because benefits are not being accessed, have been
   withdrawn or are being withheld. There may be serious
   safeguarding concerns in relation to finances.
   --
   
   Restricted access to adequate
   financial support.
   $$$$This level applies where a person has restricted financial
   support and / or restricted choice and control over the
   use of their finances (in the absence of robust best
   interest decision making processes). This could be
   because some benefits are not being accessed or
   access to full entitlements is being restricted.
   --
    Limited financial support.
   $$$$This level applies where there is some financial support
   but of a limited nature and / or limited choice and control
   over its use (in the absence of robust best interest
   decision making processes. This could be because
   entitlement criteria are not met, benefits only cover
   essential requirements or access to full entitlements is
   being restricted.
   --
   
   Full financial support / benefits
   accessed.
   $$$$This level applies where full benefits are accessed and
   provide adequate financial support with choice and
   control to maintain a reasonable quality of life.
    Sufficient financial support.
   $$$$This level applies where there is sufficient financial
   support to maintain a good quality of life with finances
   available to support choices, control and security.
   ++++
   D. Social contact%%%%
   Social contact can take many forms but is a clear indicator within quality of life measures
   and health and wellbeing. A strong social network will typically include family and friends
   though this may be disrupted due to remote and distant placements, lack of financial
   resource or availability of support. Other important social contacts may include
   neighbours, people with similar recreational interests or those with similar cultural
   backgrounds.
   --
   
   Minimal or no appropriate social
   contact.
   $$$$This level applies where there is very little or no
   appropriate social contact. This may mean that a person
   is removed from societal contact and socially isolated,
   with little or no contact of any sort other than with paid
   support and others placed in the same service. There
   may be serious safeguarding concerns in relation to
   social isolation or the influence of inappropriate social
   contacts.
   --
    Restricted levels of social contact.
   $$$$This level applies where access to appropriate social
   contact is available but is fragile or is at risk of being lost.
   This may be for a wide range of reasons including
   behaviour, living situation, risk, staffing levels etc.
   --
   
   Social contact reliant on paid
   support.
   $$$$This level applies where some appropriate social contact
   is maintained but is reliant on paid support. There may
   be restricted choice and control over social contact.
   --
    Limited non paid social networks.
   $$$$This level applies where a person is able to maintain
   appropriate social contact independently or where social
   contact is controlled by the person through use of a
   personal budget or - social contact may however be
   limited.
   --
   
   Wide range of established non
   paid social networks.
   $$$$This level applies where a person is in full control of
   access to a wide range of appropriate social contacts
   with established social networks.
   ++++
   E. Additional marginalising factors (such as ethnicity)%%%%
   This indicator can cover a wide range of issues that can increase an individual’s
   marginalisation. This can be linked to ethnicity, gender, behaviours, sexuality,
   appearance, physical features, speech differences etc. etc.
   --
   
   Single marginalising factor having
   major impact or a range or
   marginalising factors restricting
   lifestyle.
   $$$$This level applies where there is a major impact on a
   person’s quality of life because of marginalising factors in
   addition to their learning disabilities. This may mean that
   they are more vulnerable or their life is further restricted
   to a major degree. There may be serious safeguarding
   concerns as a result of additional marginalising factors.
   --
   
   Additional marginalising factors
   having significant impact with little
   support or action being taken.
   $$$$This level applies where a significant negative impact on
   a person’s life is experienced because of additional
   marginalising factors. This may mean that they are not
   able to do certain preferred activities or lead as full a life
   as they otherwise would be able or choose to. There is
   little support or action being taken.
   --
   
   Additional marginalising factors
   having limited impact.
   $$$$This level applies where there are additional
   marginalising factors present and these have a limited
   impact on the person. This may mean they feel more
   vulnerable or feel less able to do the things they
   otherwise would be able or choose to do. Some support
   is in place but may not be appropriate or effective.
   --
   
   Minimal additional marginalising
   factors with no impact; appropriate
   support is in place and effective.
   $$$$This level applies where there are additional
   marginalising factors which are managed and supported
   in such a way as to have no or minimal impact on the
   person’s life.
   --
    No additional marginalising factors.$$$$
   There are no marginalising factors beyond the learning
   disabilities.
   ++++
   F. Safeguarding%%%%
   The inclusion of safeguarding issues within the framework enables the capture of any
   issues that may be impacting on the individuals’ safety. Such factors may have been
   captured within another indicator (financial for example) however this indicator captures
   the formalisation of such risk areas including hate crime. It also includes issues related to
   the safety of others including children.
   --
   
   Major safeguarding concerns /
   current abuse or hate crime
   $$$$This level applies where there are current or major
   safeguarding issues that need to be, or are being
   addressed. This may be because of concerns of active
   abuse or hate crime occurring, or there is an immediate
   serious risk to the person or others.
   --
   
   Significant safeguarding concerns /
   risk of abuse or hate crime
   $$$$This level applies where there are major risks that could
   require a safeguarding response. There may be
   indications of possible abuse, hate crime or risk to others
   that require monitoring; there may be a lack of recording,
   monitoring and transparency in support systems.
   --
    Limited safeguarding concerns.
   $$$$This level applies where there are concerns of a
   safeguarding nature that may impact on the person or
   others. This could be where the person is in shared
   accommodation where abuse or hate crime toward
   another individual has been identified. There may be
   cultural issues within the support environment which
   need to be addressed.
   --
   1F Minimal safeguarding risks.
   $$$$This level applies where a person may be vulnerable but
   the current safeguarding or hate crime risks are minimal
   and there is good monitoring, transparency and
   recording in place.
   --
    No safeguarding concerns.
   $$$$This level applies where there are no current
   safeguarding or hate crime concerns and any risks are
   ||||
2. Genetic and Biological Indicators.
   ++++
   A. Assessment of physical and mental health needs and health checks%%%%
   The assessment of physical and / or mental health needs can be complex
   Many specific health conditions are considerably more prevalent in the learning disability
   population, epilepsy, respiratory conditions, anxiety for example
   There can be difficulties in detecting and recognising conditions and symptoms (often
   atypical) of specific health conditions. Understanding interactions between specific
   learning disability conditions and the environment also requires consideration. Annual
   Health checks can help to reduce some of these difficulties.
   --
   
   Physical and / or mental health
   needs not assessed and / or there
   is no current annual health check.
   $$$$This level applies where there has been no appropriate
   or effective assessment of needs and / or no annual
   health check. There is likely to be undiagnosed illness
   because signs and symptoms have not been recognised.
   Health problems may be seen as part of the learning
   disability (diagnostic overshadowing). There will be a
   lack of health surveillance for people who have problems
   communicating. There may be serious safeguarding
   concerns in relation to the assessment of health needs.
   --
   
   Physical and / or mental health
   needs remain under assessment
   and / or an annual health check is
   planned but has not been
   completed.
   $$$$This level applies where there have been delays in
   completing assessment processes. It may be that
   inconsistent approaches have been taken to diagnosis of
   illness because signs and symptoms have not always
   been recognised or understood. Pain assessment is
   likely to be very limited.
   --
   
   Physical and / or mental health
   needs have been assessed /
   health check done but actions are
   not in place.
   $$$$This level applies where an assessment has been
   carried out but there are delays in meeting the needs that
   have been identified. It may be that the needs are not
   being prioritised or that the complexity of meeting the
   need is preventing appropriate action from being taken or
   referral for other interventions has not been made.
   --
   
   Physical and / or mental health
   needs have been assessed, a
   health check carried out and are
   being acted on.
   $$$$This level applies where needs have been properly
   assessed and appropriate action is being taken. The
   identified needs are not yet resolved but progress is
   being made.
   --
   
   Physical and / or mental health
   needs assessed and fully met.
   $$$$This level applies where needs have been fully assessed
   and appropriate action has been taken that fully meets
   those needs.
   ++++
   B. Long Term Condition (LTC) pathways and planned reviews of need%%%%
   Many people with learning disabilities have long term conditions, however the established
   pathways for the treatment of such conditions (dementia, epilepsy, diabetes etc.) are not
   always provided. People’s needs change over time and therefore require regular review.
   Some people with learning disabilities can continue to receive treatments that are no
   longer appropriate or required
   --
   
   No Long Term Condition (LTC)
   pathway allocation or planned
   review.
   $$$$This level applies where there are health issues which
   have not been, or are not being followed up. There may
   be a lack of sensitivity or awareness of health signs and
   symptoms. Recognition of changes in health state is
   likely to be very poor. Indicated long term care pathway
   allocation has not been made. There may be serious
   safeguarding concerns in relation to care pathway
   allocation or review of needs.
   --
   3B
   Awaiting review and / or Long
   Term Condition (LTC) pathway
   allocation.
   $$$$This level applies where the need for a review is
   acknowledged but has not taken place. There will be
   known health issues that need to be followed up.
   Recognition of health signs, symptoms and changes in
   health state is likely to be inconsistent.
   --
   
   Review of needs completed but
   not acted on such as allocation
   onto Long Term Condition (LTC)
   pathway.
   $$$$This level applies where a review of needs has been
   carried out but the required actions have yet to be
   implemented. It may be that the actions are not being
   prioritised or that the complexity of making the required
   changes is preventing appropriate action from being
   taken.
   --
   
   Review of needs completed and
   acted on such as allocation onto
   Long Term Condition (LTC)
   pathway.
   $$$$This level applies where a review of needs has been
   carried out and the actions arising from it are being
   implemented. This could be that long term condition
   pathway actions are being carried out with reasonable
   adjustments.
   --
    Review of needs not required.
   $$$$This level applies if there are no needs indicated or
   identified which require review. There is no requirement
   for any intervention.
   ++++
   C. Care Planning / health action planning%%%%
   Care planning is the means by which care needs are identified. The care plan is an
   important focus for good communication; it should guide the work of others and be a
   basis for continuity of care. Health Action plans identify what needs to happen and who
   needs to do it. There can be difficulties if these plans are unclear, inadequate,
   misleading, contradictory or not acted on appropriately.
   --
   
   No Care plans / Health action
   plans in place.
   $$$$This level applies where the person has needs requiring
   specific actions but no care plans are in place. This
   means that the person is not getting adequate support
   with their health needs; there may be serious
   safeguarding concerns in relation to care planning.
   --
   
   Non condition specific care plans /
   Health Action plans in place (not
   condition specific, or NICE
   compliant).
   $$$$This level applies where a person has care plans in place
   but they do not address the specific conditions that are
   known to exist. For example someone with Down’s
   syndrome who does not have thyroid function testing
   identified in their care planning, or someone with
   epilepsy who does not have a care plan for the
   management of seizures that is in line with NICE
   guidance.
   --
   
   Condition specific, NICE compliant
   care plans / Health Action Plans in
   place but not reviewed or person
   centred.
   $$$$This level applies where care plans are in place to
   address specific known conditions; however the plans
   are generic and not individualised or person centred. It is
   likely that the care plans have not been effectively
   reviewed.
   --
   
   Condition specific, NICE compliant
   care plans / Health Action Plans in
   place, person centred and
   regularly reviewed.
   $$$$This level applies where there are known assessed
   needs for which specific care plans exist. The care plans
   will be based around the specific needs of the person in
   a personalised way. The care plans will be regularly and
   effectively reviewed.
   --
   
   No care plans or Health Action
   Plans required.
   $$$$This level applies where there is no requirement for care
   plans as a full and thorough assessment has not
   identified any unmet needs.
   ++++
   D. Crisis / emergency planning and hospital passports%%%%
   Emergency plans can prevent a lot of the difficulties associated with a crisis or urgent
   admission to hospital. They are only effective if they are regularly reviewed and updated
   and they focus on the specific needs of the individual, are person centred and take
   account of local circumstances. Hospital passports help to ensure that an individual’s
   needs are met if and when they need to be admitted or if they require hospital treatment
   or assessment.
   --
   
   No crisis, emergency or relapse
   plans (where appropriate) or
   hospital passport in place.
   $$$$This level applies where there are no plans to respond to
   a crisis of health need. A hospital passport has not been
   completed. There may be serious safeguarding concerns
   in relation to crisis or emergency planning.
   --
   
   Crisis / emergency / relapse plans
   and hospital passport in place, not
   person centred or reviewed.
   $$$$This level applies where crisis and / or emergency plans,
   and a hospital passport have been completed but are
   inadequate or out of date; this may be because they are
   not person centred, not robust or fit for purpose.
   --
   
   Crisis / emergency / relapse plans
   and hospital passport in place, not
   reviewed.
   $$$$This level applies where crisis and / or emergency plans,
   and a hospital passport are person centred but have not
   been reviewed.
   --
   
   Crisis / emergency / relapse plans
   and hospital passport in place, are
   person centred and reviewed.
   $$$$This level applies where crisis, emergency and, where
   appropriate, relapse plans and a hospital passport are all
   in place. These plans are person centred, individualised
   and regularly reviewed.
   --
   
   No crisis / emergency plans
   required, hospital passport in
   place.
   $$$$This level applies where a person does not require any
   emergency or crisis plans; they are likely to have good
   networks of support and good communication. A hospital
   passport is complete, person centred and up to date.
   ++++
   E. Medication%%%%
   Due to increased co-morbidity, people with learning disabilities often take multiple
   medications giving rise to complex interactions. In some instances they are more prone
   to adverse and atypical effects of medications and yet may have difficulty reporting side
   effects which are hazardous to health and wellbeing. People who present challenging
   behaviour may be subjected to unlicensed prescribing of anti-psychotics. On occasion
   people may require covert administration of medication; this should always be subject to
   appropriate capacity assessment and best interest processes.
   --
   
   Inappropriate medication or
   unlawful covertly administered
   medication.
   $$$$This level applies where medication is being used that is
   not in keeping with the individual’s identified needs e.g.
   not prescribed for a diagnosed and / or licensed use, or
   in excess of recommended dose limits. Medication
   recommended for short term use may have been taken
   for prolonged periods without regular review (e.g.
   benzodiazepine anxiolytics, prophylactic antibiotics); Or
   medication which has hazardous side effects and a
   narrow therapeutic window- or where medication is being
   given covertly without consent (where there is capacity)
   or best interest decision. Those providing support are not
   managing medication safely or there are major problems
   with compliance. There may be serious safeguarding
   concerns in relation to medication.
   --
   
   Medication not reviewed and / or
   regularly monitored.
   $$$$This level applies where despite poly-pharmacy
   medication continues to be administered without a
   specialist review; or the effectiveness, or side effects are
   not being adequately monitored. A full review of all
   medication should occur annually as a minimum. Those
   providing support are not managing medication
   appropriately or there are significant problems with
   compliance.
   --
   
   Medication reviewed but not
   regularly monitored.
   $$$$This level applies where medication may be being
   reviewed (perhaps annually) but there is poor on-going
   monitoring of effectiveness or side effects. Those
   providing support are not monitoring or recording
   medication effectively or there are limited problems with
   compliance.
   --
   
   Medication reviewed and
   monitored.
   $$$$This level applies where medication is carefully
   monitored and recorded with regular and appropriate
   review. Those providing support are monitoring and
   recording medication effectively and there are minimal
   problems with compliance.
   --
    No medication.
   $$$$This level applies where there is no current medication
   required.
   ++++
   F. Specialist learning disability service provision%%%%
   This indicator relates to the access and quality of specialist learning disability services
   and their ability to provide a level of support that meets an individual’s specialist health
   needs that would otherwise not be met in a mainstream setting alone.
   --
   
   No specialist learning disability
   service provision available.
   $$$$This level applies where a specialist learning disability
   service is not available to an individual. This may be
   because there is a lack of specialist service provision
   locally or that access is being denied or withheld. There
   may be serious safeguarding concerns. In relation to the
   lack of appropriate specialist service provision.
   --
   
   Restricted specialist learning
   disability services available, not
   able to meet all identified needs.
   $$$$This level applies where some specialist learning
   disability service is available but access may be
   restricted, delayed or not available locally. There is no
   support to access the service available. There may be
   areas of identified need that cannot be met.
   --
   
   Limited specialist learning disability
   service available.
   $$$$This level applies where a limited specialist learning
   disability service is available locally and being provided
   but there are limitations in the quality or scope of the
   service available. There is limited support to access the
   service.
   --
   1F
   Full specialist learning disability
   service available.
   $$$$This level applies where a full high quality specialist
   service is available and being accessed by the individual.
   There is adequate support to access the service.
   --
   
   Full specialist learning disability
   service available but not currently
   required.
   $$$$This level applies where a full, high quality and
   appropriate service is available but not currently
   required.
   ||||
3. Communication Difficulties and Reduced Health Literacy
   Indicators.
   ++++
   A. Poor bodily awareness, reduced pain responses and communication%%%%
   support
   The ability of individuals to recognise normal and abnormal bodily sensations including
   pain can vary. Some people may be at serious risk because of their inability to express
   themselves effectively and the inability of others to understand / or respond appropriately.
   Some people present behaviours described as challenging in response to pain.
   --
   
   Major restrictions of bodily
   awareness, pain responses and
   communication support.
   $$$$This level applies where a person is completely unable to
   recognise abnormal bodily sensations and is able to
   show little or no discernible response to pain; they
   receive no appropriate support with identifying needs.
   There may be serious safeguarding concerns in relation
   to bodily awareness, pain responses and communication
   support.
   --
   
   Significant restrictions of bodily
   awareness, pain responses and
   communication support.
   $$$$This level applies where a person is significantly
   restricted in their capacity to recognise abnormal bodily
   sensations including pain and distress, and who receives
   inadequate appropriate support with identifying needs.
   Non-verbal indicators of pain and distress have not been
   identified.
   --
   
   Limited restrictions of bodily
   awareness, pain responses and
   communication support.
   $$$$This level applies where a person has some limitations in
   recognising abnormal bodily sensations including pain,
   and who receives limited support from others with
   identifying needs. Non-verbal indicators of pain / distress
   will have been assessed and described but are not
   always acted on.
   --
   
   Minimal restrictions of bodily
   awareness, pain responses and
   communication support.
   $$$$This level applies where a person has some limitations in
   bodily awareness or shows largely normal responses to
   pain. They receive appropriate support with identifying
   needs.
   --
   
   No identified lack of bodily
   awareness, pain responses and
   communication support.
   $$$$This level applies where a person has good bodily
   awareness and can show normal adaptive responses to
   pain / distress.
   ++++
   B. Communicating health needs to others%%%%
   People with learning disabilities have varying ability to communicate their health issues to
   others. Those offering support may miss the significance of behavioural indicators of pain
   / discomfort / distress.
   --
   
   Major restrictions in ability to
   communicate with others and in
   support provided in relation to
   communication.
   $$$$This level applies where there are major difficulties as a
   result of highly complex needs in relation to a person’s
   communication, such that they are completely unable to
   communicate with others. They do not receive
   appropriate support or resources to aid communication of
   health needs. There may be serious safeguarding
   concerns in relation to communication of health needs.
   --
   3B
   Significant restrictions in ability to
   communicate with others and in
   support provided in relation to
   communication.
   $$$$This level applies where there are significant difficulties
   as a result of complex needs and extremely limited
   communication with others. They receive inadequate or
   inappropriate support to aid communication of health

   related to the person’s ability to communicate with
   others. They can articulately describe their signs,
   symptoms, concerns and health needs to others.
   ++++
   C. Carers ability to recognise expressions of needs / pain%%%%
   It is important that people providing care or support, have access to training or support
   about communication and the identification and management of pain, illness and
   distress. Health action plans, hospital and communication passports should include
   information on how the person communicates pain/distress and how this is managed.

   those providing support to
   recognise pain / distress.
   $$$$This level applies where there are major difficulties
   associated with failure to recognise pain, distress or ill
   health resulting in a likely deterioration of physical and /
   or mental health and wellbeing. There may be serious
   safeguarding concerns relating to the recognition of
   needs / pain.

   to self-report or there is a robust person centred process
   in place for ensuring effective, timely interventions to
   treat pain, distress and ill health.
   ++++
   D. Carers ability to recognise and respond to emerging health problems and /
   or promote health literacy%%%%
   People with learning disabilities can present atypically in response to changing health
   status. There may be behavioural or emotional changes to pain or distress. People may
   lack the cognitive or communicative skills to describe their experiences, understand the
   nature of their condition or the importance of adherent to treatment plans. There may be
   a degree of dependence on carers to recognise changes in presentation which when
   considered in totality may be indicative of a health problem and carers may be supported
   in enabling people to understand their health through access to resources.

   Individuals have full access to appropriate person-
   centred health promotion and education; and to clear
   understandable information about health care and
   treatment.
   ++++
   E. Understanding Health Information and Making Choices%%%%
   People who have learning disabilities often have difficulty in understanding health
   information this can affect their ability to make informed choices. It is essential that
   people are empowered wherever possible to make choices based on information that is
   designed to meet their needs.
   --

4. Personal Behaviour and Lifestyle Indicators.
   ++++
   A. Diet and hydration%%%%
   People with learning disabilities commonly take poor diets. In some instances, due to
   reduced health literacy, they have a poor understanding of what a healthy diet is. Other
   people are dependent on carer knowledge to ensure they receive a balanced and
   nutritious diet. Some people risk health complications associated with excessive or
   restricted fluid intake. People may have specific dietary requirements due to other health
   conditions, or medication side effects. Given the high incidence of swallowing difficulties,
   some people require food and drinks to be of a modified safe consistency.
   --
   
   Major restrictions to healthy eating
   and drinking.
   $$$$This level applies where the person has known
   swallowing difficulties but is not having the consistency of
   their food modified. May take little or no food or fluid
   without considerable encouragement and this is not
   readily available. Eats hazardous (otherwise inedible)
   items. Takes foods hazardous to known health status
   e.g. high sugar foods if diabetic or foods contraindicated
   by medication with no support to modify. Or there are
   serious safeguarding concerns.
   --
   
   Significant restrictions to healthy
   eating and drinking.
   $$$$This level applies where food consistency is not wholly
   safe. The person may drink excessively or alternately
   takes minimal fluids. The amount of food taken is a
   significant concern. There may be a complete omission
   of one or more essential component (e.g. fruit, veg or
   dairy products) OR an extreme excess of an unhealthy
   constituent of food (e.g. salt or saturated fat) OR wholly
   inadequate calorific intake. Little support to modify
   nutritional intake.
   --
   
   Limited restrictions to healthy
   eating and drinking.
   $$$$This level applies where the person takes a mix of grain
   based foods, milk, meat, veg and fruit though widely
   discrepant from normal recommended daily amounts –
   some support to address these issues and support
   healthy intake. If food consistency is an issue there may
   be occasional lapses of stringency in support.
   --
   
   Minimal restrictions to healthy
   eating and drinking.
   $$$$This level applies where the person takes adequate food
   and fluid of safe and appropriate consistency. There may
   be relative excesses or limitations of some key areas of
   nutritional intake. Meals may lack variety or have
   modestly excessive salt content. Support is available to
   address known issues.
   --
   
   No restrictions to healthy eating
   and drinking.
   $$$$This level applies where the person takes a healthy
   balanced diet consistent with their needs and prepared in
   a manner which can be taken without risk. They take 6-8
   glasses of water (or other fluids) per day and carers are
   well informed and provide support regarding public
   health recommendations on healthy eating.
   ++++
   B. Exercise%%%%
   People with learning disabilities often lead a more sedentary lifestyle than non-disabled
   peers. There may be issues of motivation or inadequate levels of support to allow
   engagement in exercise. Some people have extremely complex physical disabilities that
   mean traditional activities by way of exercise are difficult to engage in. Exercise can be a
   lifestyle activity (in other words, walking to the shops or taking the dog out) or structured
   exercise or sport, or a combination of these; it does need to be of at least moderate
   intensity, measured by it making the person slightly breathless or a little warm.
   --
   
   Major restrictions related to
   exercise.
   $$$$This level applies where the person takes little or no
   exercise of an even mild intensity. May be immobile or
   just sedately mobilising around living environment. Poses
   risks to skin integrity, cardiovascular system, bones and
   joints. Alternatively may undertake high intensity,
   vigorous activity despite significant underlying medical
   conditions which mean excessive cardio vascular work
   load should be avoided. No appropriate support with
   exercise in place. There may be serious safeguarding
   concerns in relation to exercise.
   --
   3B
   Significant restrictions related to
   exercise.
   $$$$This level applies where the person takes little or no
   moderately vigorous exercise, or undertakes energetic
   activity for brief periods only; no more than once or twice
   a week. Restricted access to support, understanding in
   relation to exercise of those providing support is minimal.
   --
   
   Limited restrictions related to
   exercise.
   $$$$This level applies where the person takes less than a
   weekly total of an hour and a half of moderately vigorous
   activity. Takes such exercise on less than four days per
   week. Support available but not appropriately
   implemented or utilised.
   --
   
   Minimal restrictions related to
   exercise.
   $$$$This level applies where the person undertakes
   moderate intensity activity on four or five days per week,
   or for less than 30 minutes in a day. Appropriate support
   and encouragement is provided.
   --
    No restrictions related to exercise.
   $$$$This level applies where the person takes a degree of
   exercise of a nature and quantity appropriate to age and
   general health condition. A mixture of aerobic and
   muscle strengthening activities on five or more days per
   week. No support required.
   ++++
   C. Weight%%%%
   People with learning disabilities are prone to being either overweight or underweight.
   Obesity brings a whole range of risks in its own right and can also increase the
   hazardous nature of exposure to other determinants of health in (e.g. genetic cardio
   vascular problems or hazardous medications). Being underweight or malnourished
   increases risk of serious medical complications including recurrent infection and impaired
   renal function.
   --
   
   Major restrictions to maintaining
   appropriate weight.
   $$$$This level applies where BMI is less than 15 or over 40.
   There has been unplanned loss of more than 10%
   weight over 3-6 months.
   No support available to achieve or maintain appropriate
   weight.
   There may be serious safeguarding concerns in relation
   to weight.
   --

   appropriate weight.
   --
   
   Limited restrictions to maintaining
   appropriate weight.
   $$$$This level applies where BMI is between 16-18.5 OR 30-5. There is unplanned loss of less than 5% weight over 3-6
   months.
   Support available but not appropriately implemented or
   utilised to achieve or maintain appropriate weight.
   --
   
   Minimal restrictions to maintaining
   appropriate weight.

   stable.
   Appropriate support and encouragement is provided to
   achieve or maintain appropriate weight.
   --
   
   No restrictions to maintaining
   appropriate weight.
   $$$$This level applies where BMI is between 18-25.
   Weight is stable. No support is required to achieve or
   maintain appropriate weight.
   ++++
   D. Substance Use%%%%
   Vulnerable people can be become engaged in the harmful use of alcohol, smoking and
   non-prescription drugs and other harmful substances. This can make them particularly
   vulnerable to exploitation and may result in problems with relationships, finances and
   offending behaviour. They may find it difficult, or be reluctant to engage with activities to
   change their behaviours. Some people may have developed ritualised behaviours or be
   dependent on routine.
   In addition people often need support from others, who may not be well informed about
   the harmful impact of alcohol, smoking and other dangerous substances, or skilled in
   supporting and managing risky behaviours.
   --
   
   Dependence on drugs, alcohol, or
   other harmful substances.%%%%
   $$$$This level applies where there is evidence of a strong
   compulsion to take the desired substance, where a
   withdrawal state is associated with abstinence There
   may be evidence of tolerance (indicated by increasing
   quantities of the desired substance being required to
   achieve the desired effect). Alternative pleasures are
   neglected. No support or access to services in place.
   There may be serious safeguarding concerns in relation
   to substance use.
   --
   
   Harmful use of drugs, alcohol,
   tobacco or other harmful
   substances.$$$$
   There is an evident pattern of substance use which has
   significantly contributed to physical, psychological or
   social harm. Limited support or access to services.
   --
   
   Hazardous use of drugs alcohol,
   tobacco or other harmful
   substances.
   $$$$This level applies where consumption is associated with
   a significantly increased risk of harm, albeit that there is
   currently no evidence of actual harm. This is the minimal
   level that is associated with recreational drug use. Some
   support provided.
   --
   
   Minimal misuse of alcohol or
   tobacco.
   $$$$This level applies where there is evidence of some risky
   behaviour in relation to the use of alcohol or tobacco.
   Behaviours demonstrated are considered to pose a
   limited risk to the person’s health and wellbeing with
   potential for morbidity. E.g. where the person generally
   keeps alcohol consumption to a safe level, but
   occasionally drinks an excessive amount. Support
   available if needed.
   --
   
   No harmful pattern of substance
   use.
   $$$$This level applies where there is use of no substances
   other than alcohol and where drinking is within Public
   Health recommended safe limits. (or where there is no
   use of alcohol). Consumption poses a minimal risk to
   health and wellbeing. E.g. Where the person consumes
   alcohol regularly but the amount is considered
   acceptable (Per week- at least two alcohol-free days,
   Men- no more than 21 units & no more than four units a
   day, Women- no more than 14 units, & no more than
   three units a day).
   ++++
   E. Sexual Health%%%%
   Many people with learning disabilities engage in appropriate and healthy sexual acts and
   relationships. If they do this without having accessed sexual health services / education
   this may place their health at risk. Others are vulnerable and at risk of exploitation or
   given a lack of appropriate role models may engage in behaviours that are considered to
   be sexually unusual or unsafe (if not illegal).
   --
   
   Very high risk sexual behaviours.
   Sexual abuse or sexual offending.$$$$
   In an abusive / exploitative sexual relationship.
   Engages in sexual offending behaviour.
   Has unprotected sex with people who are at high risk for
   sexually transmitted disease.
   No positive role models for normal, adaptive sexual
   relationships.
   No support provided.
   There may be serious safeguarding concerns in relation
   to sexual health.
   --
   
   Unsafe and risky sexual
   behaviours.$$$$
   Has frequent unprotected sex of a nature that is
   hazardous to health, poses serious safeguarding issues
   or is illegal.
   Has been exposed to sexually inappropriate role models.
   Has had (and failed to detect) chronic sexually
   transmitted disease.
   Restricted support provided Limited support or access to
   services.
   --
   
   Inappropriate sexual behaviours
   increasing vulnerability.$$$$
   Has limited awareness of sexual rights / norms though is
   sexually active.
   Has limited access to sexual health services. Limited
   understanding of what constitutes safe sex.
   Has had a lack of sexually positive role models.
   Lives in an environment where others display sexually
   inappropriate behaviours.
   Sexually active but not using contraception. Some
   support provided.
   --
   
   Safe sexual behaviours of a
   restricted nature$$$$
   Has accessed contraceptive advice both to avoid
   pregnancy and the risk of sexually transmitted diseases.
   Is interested in sex though is sexually isolated.
   Appropriate support provided.
   --
    Healthy sexual behaviours.$$$$
   Engages in safe sexual practices or does not engage in
   sexual activity by choice. Ready access to sexual health
   screening services.
   ++++
   F. Risky Behaviour / Routines%%%%
   Presentations of behaviours that may be described as ‘challenging’ i.e. place the safety
   and wellbeing of the service user and / or others in jeopardy or which increase the
   likelihood of a person being excluded from ordinary community living, may increase the
   risk of poor health. Such behaviours include aggression, self injury, destructive
   behaviours and other difficult or disruptive behaviours (in some instances this latter
   category may include people who have rigid and fixed routines / habits of such intensity
   that they prevent the person from engaging in positive health behaviours). Clearly self
   injury carries such risks as may the defensive or restraining actions of others.
   Consequences of all behaviours include greater exposure to abuse, inappropriate
   treatments, social exclusion, deprivation and neglect; each of these can have significant
   additional negative impacts. People who present such behaviours may be at heightened
   risk of such behaviours being viewed as being inevitably associated with their learning
   disability rather than indicative of poor health. Some fixed routines mean that people are
   resistive to making lifestyle changes which promote improved health.
   --
   
   Major health implications related to
   presentation of severe behavioural
   disturbance.$$$$
   The person presents behaviours which are of a
   frequency, severity or intensity that there is a high risk
   that unplanned hospital attendances will be required due
   to severe injury. Or the person’s behaviours mean they
   have no access to usual health provision. Or the
   person’s situation is such that they are exposed to
   abusive contingencies. The factors that predict the
   occurrence or, and maintain behaviours are unknown.
   --
   
   Behaviours / routines have
   significant impact on health status.$$$$
   The person presents behaviours for reasons which are
   poorly understood, which mean that they commonly
   require first aid or occasionally suffer more serious
   illness / injury which require medical attention. There
   may be occasional dramatic escalations in the severity /
   frequency of behaviours of concern. In an attempt to
   manage risks the person may be subjected to restrictive
   environment or hazardous treatments.
   --
   
   Limited impact of risky behaviours
   / routines on health.$$$$
   The person presents with a range of behaviours of
   concern. Causative factors have been partially assessed
   and are partly understood. Access to routine healthcare
   provision may be difficult to arrange or investigations not
   pursued as not felt justifiably to be in the person’s best
   interests. The impact of behaviours is relatively stable
   and their frequency / severity is neither increasing nor
   reducing.
   --
   
   Behavioural presentation has
   minimal impact on health status.$$$$
   The person presents occasional hazardous behaviours
   or has some rigidity however these have been assessed
   and a package of proactive and reactive strategies
   agreed. These are consistently implemented and the
   outcomes of these strategies are closely monitored and
   regularly reviewed. The person has unimpaired access to
   the usual range of local health provision.
   --
   
   No presentation of risky
   behaviours / routines.$$$$
   The person does not present culturally abnormal
   behaviours which place themselves or others safety /
   wellbeing in serious jeopardy or risk the person being
   denied access to ordinary community facilities.
   ||||
   5. Deficiencies in Service Quality and Access Indicators.
   ++++
   A. Organisational barriers%%%%
   There are a wide range of organisational barriers to accessing healthcare and other
   services. Some services are scarce and there may be eligibility criteria preventing
   access. It is not always easy for people to physically access services e.g. they may be in
   a location that is far away and transport may be a problem. Services often do not
   understand / or recognise the need to make ‘Reasonable Adjustments’. Generic health
   care staff often lack knowledge, skills and confidence, and on occasion, has negative
   attitudes in relation to caring for people who have learning disabilities. This can lead to diagnostic overshadowing.
   --
   
   Major restrictions in the quality of
   or access to services associated

   $$$$This level applies where there are major difficulties
   resulting from an organisation’s complete lack of
   understanding and awareness about the nature of
   learning disabilities, there is a complete lack of
   recognition of diagnostic overshadowing and no
   evidence of reasonable adjustments. Services are
   refused or inaccessible, Treatment or intervention is
   withheld, delayed or inappropriate. There is no support to
   access or even register with services. There may be
   serious safeguarding concerns in relation to
   organisational barriers to services.

   nature of learning disabilities, the recognition of
   diagnostic overshadowing and importance or reasonable
   adjustments. Training is in place for staff, although this is
   not mandatory and some staff have not been trained
   leading to some inadequacy and inconsistency in service
   provision. There is some support to access services.

   adjustments. Mandatory learning disability training is in
   place for staff. There is adequate support to access
   services.
   ++++
   B. Consent%%%%
   People with learning disabilities may or may not have capacity to give consent and
   capacity may vary. Sometimes professionals do not take the time to gain consent from
   the person with the learning disability, even if they may have capacity, consulting the
   person’s carer or family member instead. Understanding of the mental capacity act or
   other appropriate national legislation can be limited and appropriate best interest
   processes are not always followed when making decisions for those who lack capacity.
   Training is not always available or accessed.

   C. Transitions between services%%%%
   Transition between services is often reported as problematic for some people with
   learning disability; this may for example include transition from children’s services to adult
   or adult to older people’s services, but equally could be transition between hospital
   services and home or community services, or transitions from one phase of education to
   another. Common problems include poor planning, variable and mismatched eligibility
   criteria, lack of clarity from professionals and poor co-ordination between services,
   together with low levels of satisfaction among family carers

   Complete breakdown in transition
   between services.
   $$$$This level applies where there are major difficulties
   resulting from poor practices in transition processes.
   There will be no named coordinator to enable transition
   and policies protocols will be non-existent or completely
   inadequate. This may result in no appropriate service or
   completely unsafe services being provided and serious
   delays in the effective transition of services. There may
   be serious safeguarding concerns in relation to transition
   between services.

   $$$$This level applies where there are significant difficulties
   resulting from poor practices in transition processes.
   There will be very little coordination available to support
   transition; policies protocols are inadequate, ineffective
   and require updating This results in unsafe or inadequate
   services being provided and significant delays in the
   effective transition of services.

   $$$$This level applies where there are minimal difficulties
   resulting from transition processes. There will be a
   named coordinator available to support transition,
   policies/ protocols are current. Local services may have
   some limitations resulting in occasional delays in the
   effective transition of services requiring additional
   support.

   support required.
   $$$$This level applies where there are no identified difficulties
   related to transition processes. There will be a named
   coordinator available to support transition, policies/
   protocols are current. Local services are well placed to
   ensure smooth and effective transition pathways no
   additional support is required.

   D. Health screening / promotion%%%%
   Access to health promotion may be significantly poorer for people with more severe
   learning disabilities and people with learning disabilities who do not use learning disability
   services. In particular people are less likely to access assessment for vision or hearing
   impairments; routine dental care; cervical smear tests undertake breast self-
   examinations or attend for mammography.
   Sometimes care staff are not sufficiently trained and have limited skills to effectively
   engage people with learning disabilities in health promotion activities and many don’t
   know important relevant information such as a person’s family history.

   Major restrictions in the or quality
   of or access to health promotion /
   screening.
   $$$$This level applies where health screening / promotion
   programmes and activities are not available to meet
   identified needs. This may be because there is a lack of
   service provision or support or that access is being
   denied or withheld. Those providing support have no
   training and skills to promote and support good health.
   There may be serious safeguarding concerns in relation
   to health screening or health promotion.

   $$$$This level applies where there is full access and support
   to health screening / promotion programmes and
   activities. There are accessible materials, and person
   centred reasonable adjustments. Those providing
   support are adequately trained and skilled to promote
   and support good health.

   E. Primary / secondary care%%%%
   People who have learning disabilities may access primary and secondary health care
   less frequently than the general population for screening, assessment, treatment and
   other interventions. Annual health checks including health screening should be
   conducted by primary care; and follow up and treatment provided appropriately to ensure
   health needs are met in a timely manner. All health services should be ensuring
   reasonable adjustments are made to enable access to the same health outcomes as
   would be expected for people who do not have learning disabilities.

   F. Non health Services%%%%
   Wellbeing, health and quality of life are influenced by services other than health services
   including for example social care, education, employment, housing, transport and leisure
   services; this may be especially true for people with learning disabilities who may be
   regular users of these services.
   All public services should be ensuring reasonable adjustments are made to enable
   access and equal outcomes as would be expected for people who do not have learning
   disabilities.
